To configure Cursor's auto-run settings for allowed terminal commands:

1. **Open Cursor Settings**
   - Press `Cmd + ,` (macOS) or `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or go to **Cursor** → **Settings** → **Cursor Settings**

2. **Navigate to Features → Terminal**
   - In the settings sidebar, look for **Features** section
   - Click on **Terminal**

3. **Configure Auto-Run Commands**
   - You'll find options like:
     - **Auto-run mode**: Choose between "ask", "auto", or "never"
     - **Allowlist**: Add specific commands or patterns that are always allowed to run automatically
     - **Blocklist**: Add commands that should never auto-run

4. **Adding Allowed Commands**
   - In the allowlist, you can add:
     - Exact commands: `npm run dev`
     - Patterns with wildcards: `npm *`, `git status`
     - Common safe commands like `ls`, `cat`, `echo`

**Quick tip**: You can also access these settings by clicking the gear icon in the terminal panel or by searching "terminal auto run" in the settings search bar.
