# GlobalDashboardConfig export issue (2026-01-17 19:12Z)

_**User (2026-01-17 16:24Z)**_

I'm getting the following error in my code:

**Problem in hass-config/dashboards/shared.js:**
- **Type:** Error
- **Line 13:** Namespace '"/Users/sharonfrenkel/Dev/hass-config/inventory/types/config"' has no exported member 'GlobalDashboardConfig'.
- **Code:** 2694
- **Source:** ts

Can you help me understand and fix this issue? @shared.js

The user is getting a TypeScript error in their `shared.js` file. The error says that there's no exported member 'GlobalDashboardConfig' in the types file they're importing from.

Let me look at the type definition file to understand what's available and what the correct type name should be.</details></think>

📗 Let me check the type definition file to see what types are actually exported.

I see the issue. The file defines `DashboardConfig` but the code is trying to import `GlobalDashboardConfig`. Looking at the `shared.js` file, it seems like it's defining a global/shared config that multiple dashboards would extend.

Looking at the structure:
- `DashboardConfig` includes `template` and `output` which are required fields
- The shared config in `shared.js` doesn't have these fields - it has shared settings like `language`, `pinned_areas`, `excluded_areas`, etc.

It looks like there should be a separate type for the global/shared dashboard config that doesn't require template-specific fields. The user needs either:
1. A `GlobalDashboardConfig` type to be added to the types file
2. Or use a different existing type

Looking at the config in `shared.js`, it has:
- `schemaVersion`
- `language`
- `pinned_areas`
- `excluded_areas`
- `default_scene_suffix`
- `areas` (with `DashboardAreaConfig` properties)

This is clearly meant to be a shared config that gets extended by specific dashboard configs. The type `GlobalDashboardConfig` needs to be created.

Let me look at how this is used in the generator to understand the expected structure better.</details></think>

I can see the issue. The type file exports `DashboardConfig` but not `GlobalDashboardConfig`. Looking at the structure, `DashboardConfig` requires `template` and `output` fields which your shared config doesn't have (since it's meant to be extended by specific dashboards).

You need to add a `GlobalDashboardConfig` type for the shared configuration. Let me add it:

The error is fixed. The `GlobalDashboardConfig` type has been added and both files are now lint-free.</details></think>

🤓 The error is fixed. The issue was that the type definition file didn't export `GlobalDashboardConfig` - it only had `DashboardConfig` which requires `template` and `output` fields.

I added the `GlobalDashboardConfig` interface with:
- `schemaVersion` - required
- `language` - optional, for i18n translations
- `pinned_areas` - optional, areas to pin at top
- `excluded_areas` - optional, areas to hide
- `default_scene_suffix` - optional, for tap actions
- `areas` - optional, per-area dashboard config

This type is designed for the shared config that gets extended by specific dashboard configs (which would add `template` and `output`).
